# Flesh Out Idea

Use the `ralphy-planning:flesh-it-out-for-ralphy` skill to help the user refine their rough idea.

This is a quick refinement process (5-10 minutes) that:
1. Captures the rough idea
2. Clarifies and strengthens it by identifying contradictions and gaps
3. Hands off to full planning when ready

Use this when the user has a general idea but hasn't thought through details. After refinement, direct them to `/ralphy-planning:plan` for the full workflow.
